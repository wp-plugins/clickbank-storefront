=  Clickbank Wordpress Plugin (Storefront)  =


**Clickbank&reg;** is the World's Largest Digital Info Product Store. As a Clickbank affiliate, one can make tons of CASH by promoting these products.

**CBproAds.com Unique Features**

1. We are only plugin provider that offers **IMPROVED title & descriptions** of every clickbank products. 
   We frame the title & description of each products according to end users point of view. Many of our 
   competitor plugins show the **raw title & description** from Clickbank's marketplace which is
   non-informative to end users. Those are framed by Clickbank vendors just for attracting clickbank affiliates
   to promote their products. Please see below an example that shows the difference between them.

   Raw Clickbank title & description:

	`[Fat Loss4 Idiots.  Our Top Affiliate Has Banked More than $1,00,000 In Just few Months! Earn 66% and get paid $23.15 per sale!]`

   **CBproAds Improved** title & description:

	`[Fat Loss4 Idiots. Learn the 10 idiot proof rules of dieting & fat loss And lose 9lbs every 11 Days!  ]`


2. In other plugins, you are required to update your storefront with clickbank's data feed everyday. If you fail to update it often, 
   your storefront may not synchronized with Clickbank&reg;'s maketplace data which is crucial not to lose your commissions.

   At **CBproAds**, instead of importing Clickbank XML feed directly on to your storefront, you share our central XML data feed.
   Our central XML data feed is updated every day and contains only **IMPROVED title & descriptions** of each products.
   As soon as we update it with Clickbank's data feed everyday, it will get reflected on your plugins also automatically.

   You just install and forget. We do take care of every thing.

3. **Clickbank.com&reg;** often changes it's marketplace data XML feed structure. With our plugin, Clickbank's changes will never 
   affect your storefront as you share our IMPROVED central XML feed rather than using clickbank's XML feed directly. 
   We make sure that when ever a change is made by Clickbank, our central XML feed is too updated according to that structure and so yours too.
